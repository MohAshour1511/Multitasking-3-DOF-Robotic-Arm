# Multitasking 3 DOF Robotic Arm
 A robotic arm project with 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) multitasking capabilities, driven by ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt. It has innovative design enables seamless multitasking, empowering the arm to efficiently handle diverse tasks with precision and speed. Leveraging the power of ROS and the advanced motion planning of MoveIt.
 
 1) Design Overview: This robotic arm has three joints, three links - including base link - designed for smooth movements in any direction without end effector. Each joint is optimized for both agility and strength, making the arm versatile for various tasks.
 
 2) Multitasking Capability: Thanks to ROS, our arm can seamlessly switch between different positions without needing different attachments. Whether it's precise positioning or complex manipulations, this arm can handle it all.  
 
 3) ROS Integration: ROS is the heart of our project, giving our arm unmatched flexibility and scalability. With ROS, we can easily add new features and sensors to adapt to different needs.
 
 4) MoveIt and RViz: MoveIt helps our arm plan its movements efficiently, while RViz lets us see those plans in real-time. Together, they make controlling the arm intuitive and safe.  
 
 5) Gazebo Simulation: We use Gazebo to test our arm in a virtual environment. It's like a playground where we can try out new ideas and make sure everything works perfectly before trying it in the real world.
